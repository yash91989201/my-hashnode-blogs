## Introduction

Woo-hoo! After mastering the ins and outs of Kubernetes, we're finally ready to deploy our very own Reddit clone application using K8s! Let's get this party started!

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for this project include Docker and Kubernetes. Here is a [GitHub repositor](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/kubestarter)y that provides comprehensive, step-by-step instructions for installing Kubernetes.

## Manifest files for the deployment

Here are the manifest files for various services required to successfully deploy our Reddit clone website.

### Namespace manifest file

We need to create a separate namespace for deploying our application to avoid conflicts with other resources of different projects.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: reddit-clone-ns
  labels:
    name: dev
```

```yaml
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
```

Once the namespace is created you can switch to it from the default namespace by executing the following command:

```yaml
kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=reddit-clone-ns
```

### Deployment manifest file

Here is the deployment manifest file that we will be using to create our pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: reddit-clone-deployment
  namespace: reddit-clone-ns
  labels:
    app: reddit-clone
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: reddit-clone
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: reddit-clone
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: web-app
          image: yash6370/reddit-clone
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
```

After the `deployment.yaml` file is created we can apply it using the following command.

```yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
```

### Service Manifest file

To access the application from our worker ec2 instances we have to create a node port service that will allow us to do so.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: reddit-clone-service
  namespace: reddit-clone-ns
  labels:
    app: reddit-clone
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: reddit-clone
  ports:
    - port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
      nodePort: 31000
```

After creating the `service.yaml` file we can apply it as follows:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

## Accessing the deployed application

Obtain the IP address of one of your worker nodes and use port 31000 to access the deployed application.

## Conclusion

In the end, deploying a reddit clone with Kubernetes is easy. Just make and use files for namespaces, deployments, and services. Follow the steps in this article to launch your app and use it through the worker nodes. This shows how useful and adaptable Kubernetes is for handling apps in containers.
