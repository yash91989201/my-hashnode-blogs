## üìç Introduction

Hello readers! In [our previous blog](https://yashraj-jaiswal.hashnode.dev/introduction-to-kubernetes-an-awesome-container-orchestration-tool), we discussed Kubernetes, its architecture, and its benefits. While Kubernetes is popular, setting up a cluster can be quite challenging.

Today, we will explore two different methods for setting up a Kubernetes cluster. One method is using kubeadm, which creates a full-fledged cluster with a control plane and worker nodes. The other method involves using Minikube, which is a pared-down version of Kubernetes that gives you all the benefits of Kubernetes with a lot less effort all of the components of a k8s cluster and is created within a single docker container.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before performing the installation, make sure that you have the following points covered to ensure a smooth installation and working.

* two ec2 instances with at least t2.medium instance type because we require two cpus for our cluster to run.
    
* you must execute commands with the user that has sudo privileges.
    

## ‚úîÔ∏è Installation using kubeadm ‚öôÔ∏è

Kubeadm is a tool designed to offer *kubeadm init* and *kubeadm join* as best-practice, fast-track methods for creating Kubernetes clusters. It carries out the essential actions needed to establish a minimally viable cluster. By design, kubeadm focuses solely on bootstrapping and does not concern itself with provisioning machines.

### üî∏ Setting up the control plane (master node) üéõÔ∏è

1. **Initial Steps**
    
    Since k8s requires a container runtime to create containers, we first need to install Docker. Execute the following commands on both the master and worker nodes to prepare them for Kubeadm:
    
    ```bash
    apt update -y
    # install docker
    apt install docker.io -y
    # start docker service
    systemctl start docker
    # enable docker to run on system startup
    systemctl enable docker
    ```
    
2. **Add Kubernetes Repository and Install Kubeadm**
    
    In this step, we will be adding Kubernetes repository and then installing kubeadm, kubectl, and kubelet. Execute the following commands to achieve the former.
    
    ```bash
      curl -fsSL "https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg" | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg
      echo 'deb https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt kubernetes-xenial main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
    
      apt update -y
      apt install kubeadm=1.20.0-00 kubectl=1.20.0-00 kubelet=1.20.0-00 -y
    ```
    
3. **Initializing the control plane**
    
    ```bash
    kubeadm init
    ```
    
4. **Setting up kube config**
    
    ```bash
      mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
      sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
      sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
    ```
    
5. **Add weave net plugin**
    
    Weave Net provides a network to connect all pods, implementing the Kubernetes model. Kubernetes uses the Container Network Interface (CNI) to join pods onto Weave Net.
    
    Kubernetes implements many network features on top of the pod network. This includes Services, Service Discovery via DNS and Ingress into the cluster. WeaveDNS is disabled when using the Kubernetes addon.
    
    Execute the following command to add the Weavenet plugin.
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.8.1/weave-daemonset-k8s.yaml
    ```
    
6. **Generate a token to add worker nodes**
    
    To register a node as a worker in a control plane we need a token. Executing the following command on the control plane will generate the new token as well as the join command which you can execute at your worker node to join the cluster.
    
    ```bash
      kubeadm token create --print-join-command
    ```
    

### üî∏ Setting up worker nodes üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. **Reset kubeadm and join the worker node.**
    
    This is a step to reset all changes if we have accidentally executed any command to create a control plane on the worker node.
    
    ```bash
    kubeadm reset pre-flight checks
    ```
    
    Execute the join command on the worker node that you got while generating the join token on the control plane:
    
    ```bash
    kubeadm join <master-node-ip>:6443 --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash <hash> --v=5
    ```
    
    To verify if the worker node has joined the cluster execute the following command:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```
    
2. **Labelling your worker nodes:**
    
    Optionally we can label our worker nodes with names to identify them for our specific use cases.
    
    ```bash
    kubectl label node <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker
    ```
    
3. To confirm the successful configuration of your worker nodes, you can run a demo pod to ensure that everything is functioning correctly.
    

## ‚úîÔ∏è Quick installation using minikube ‚ö°‚ö°

For a quick installation, we can use the minikube, which will run a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally for development and testing purposes.

1. **Initial Steps**
    
    ```bash
    apt update -y
    # install docker
    apt install docker.io -y
    # start docker service
    systemctl start docker
    # enable docker to run on system startup
    systemctl enable docker
    ```
    
2. **Install supporting packages:**
    
    ```bash
    # basic required packages
    apt install -y curl wget apt-transport-https
    ```
    
3. **Install minikube**
    
    ```bash
    # install minikube
    curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
    # make minikube executable and move to the /user/local/bin directory
    chmod +x minikube
    sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
    ```
    
4. I**nstall kubectl**
    
    This is a command line tool to manage the control plane and worker nodes
    
    ```bash
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
    # make minikube executable and move to the /user/local/bin directory
    chmod +x kubectl
    sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
    ```
    
5. **minikube commands**
    
    The commands will help you manage minikube cluster.
    
    ```bash
    # start minikube
    minikube start --driver=docker
    # check cluster status
    minikube status
    # stop minikube
    minikube stop
    # delete minikube
    minikube delete
    ```
    

## ‚úîÔ∏è Let's run a pod in k8s cluster

A pod is the smallest object in Kubernetes. We can create it using the kubectl command, where we need to provide all the specifications for the pod.

However, there is an alternative method in which we input all the specifications in a YAML file and pass it to kubectl. This approach is quite convenient, and that's exactly what we'll be doing!

Create two files, nginx-pod.yaml and nginx-service.yaml, with the content provided below.

```yaml
# nginx-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx  # Add this label
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

```yaml
# nginx-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx  # Use the correct label
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort
```

After creating `nginx-pod.yaml` and `nginx-service.yaml` run the following commands:

* `kubectl create -f nginx-pod.yaml`
    
* `kubectl create -f nginx-service.yaml`
    

To access the nginx web page first execute the following command to get the port of the service that is exposing the pod `kubectl get service nginx-service`

This will produce the following output:

Use the port number beside 80: (30629 in this case) to access the nginx webpage which will be as follows.

## üìç Conclusion

Awesome, now you can set up a fully-fledged k8s cluster as well as a mini version of a cluster which can prove very useful for local development. But keep in mind that minikube is never used in production.

In the next blogs we will discover how to run applications, how networking works on kubernetes and much more, so stay tuned and keep learning.
