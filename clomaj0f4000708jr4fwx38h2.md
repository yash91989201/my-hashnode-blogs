## üìç Introduction

Hello readers, we have been studying various AWS services and engaging in hands-on practice up until now. Let's explore some essential interview questions that will be of significant help to you.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Interview Questions

1. Name 5 AWS services you have used and what are the use cases?
    
    * **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** IAM manages user identities and permissions in AWS, controlling access to resources and actions. It offers secure authentication, fine-grained authorization, and policy-based access control for improved security.
        
    * **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Amazon S3 is an object storage service for storing and retrieving large data volumes. Use cases involve data backup, restoration, archiving, content storage, distribution, and static website hosting.
        
    * **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** EC2 provides cloud-based virtual servers for executing applications and services, often used in web hosting, enterprise applications, and batch-processing tasks.
        
    * **RDS (Relational Database Service):** RDS offers managed services for relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server, streamlining administration and commonly used for application data storage, data warehousing, and analytics.
        
    * **CloudWatch:** CloudWatch is an AWS monitoring service that provides insights into resources and applications, used for tracking metrics, setting alarms, and collecting logs for troubleshooting and performance optimization.
        
2. What are the tools used to send logs to the cloud environment?
    
    Some of the AWS-specific logging services are:
    
    * **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**
        
    * **AWS CloudTrail**
        
    * **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
        
    
    Additionally, there are open-source monitoring tools available, such as **Splunk, LogStash,** and **Fluentd.**
    
3. What are IAM Roles? How do you create/manage them?
    
    Roles in AWS are a means of securely granting permissions and access to AWS services and resources. They provide temporary credentials, eliminating the need for long-term access keys. IAM roles are frequently used for cross-service interactions and allowing services to access resources without hardcoded credentials.
    
    **Following are the steps to create an IAM role:**
    
    1. Navigate to the IAM dashboard in AWS.
        
    2. Go to "Roles" and click on "Create role."
        
    3. Choose the trusted entity type, such as another AWS service or external identity provider.
        
    4. Define the use case or service that will assume the role.
        
    5. Attach policies to specify the role's permissions.
        
    6. Now create the role.
        
4. How to upgrade or downgrade a system with zero downtime?
    
    To perform a system upgrade or downgrade without experiencing any downtime, strategies such as blue-green deployment, rolling deployment, or canary deployment can be employed. These approaches involve creating a replica environment, deploying the updated version to the duplicate environment, and gradually transitioning user traffic from the old environment to the new one.
    
5. What is infrastructure as code and how do you use it?
    
    Infrastructure as Code (IAC) is the practice of creating and managing cloud resources through code. Tools such as Terraform and AWS CloudFormation are utilized to provision infrastructure for your application. While AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by AWS, Terraform is an open-source tool that works with various cloud providers, including Azure, GCP, and AWS.
    
    **To use IAC:**
    
    * Create scripts that define the resource details and configurations.
        
    * Perform checks to validate configurations before executing the script.
        
    * Provision and manage infrastructure consistently across multiple cloud providers.
        
    * Quickly provision different environments using the same configuration.
        
    * Manage the entire infrastructure lifecycle, reducing errors and increasing automation.
        
6. What is a load balancer? Give scenarios of each kind of balancer based on your experience.
    
    A load balancer is a networking device or service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources to ensure efficient utilization and high availability. It helps distribute the workload and ensures that no single server becomes overloaded, thereby improving performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.
    
    * **Application Load Balancer:** ALB intelligently routes network traffic using application-layer information (HTTP/HTTPS) for efficient workload distribution. It supports advanced routing features like path, host, and content-based routing, making it ideal for web applications, API services, and microservices architectures.
        
    * **Network Load Balancer:** NLB works at the transport layer (TCP/UDP), catering to high-volume, low-latency traffic. Ideal for ultra-low latency scenarios like gaming or real-time streaming, it provides network-level load balancing, static IP addresses, and high throughput.
        
    * **Classic Load Balancer:** CLB, the original AWS load balancer, operates at application and network layers, offering basic load balancing across instances. While lacking advanced features of ALB and NLB, it's suitable for simple applications or those needing backward compatibility.
        
7. What is CloudFormation and why is it used?
    
    AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows you to model and provision AWS resources using templates. It is utilized to automate the deployment and management of infrastructure as code in AWS, streamlining the creation, updating, and deletion of resource stacks with minimal effort.
