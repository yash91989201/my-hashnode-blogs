## üìç Introduction

Hello readers, after studying AWS services for some time, let's elevate our knowledge by exploring ECS, a fully managed container orchestration service provided by AWS. In today's blog, we will learn about ECS, and its differences from EKS, and engage in hands-on practice with ECS as well.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What is ECS?

ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a fully managed container orchestration service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It enables you to run and manage Docker containers on a cluster of virtual machines (EC2 instances) without the need to handle the underlying infrastructure.

With ECS, you can effortlessly deploy, manage, and scale your containerized applications using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the API. ECS supports both "Fargate" and "EC2 launch types," allowing you to run your containers on AWS-managed infrastructure or your own EC2 instances.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Difference between ECS and EKS

|  | ECS | EKS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Architecture** | ECS employs a centralized architecture, featuring a control plane responsible for managing the scheduling of containers on EC2 instances. | EKS employs a distributed architecture, in which the Kubernetes control plane is spread across multiple EC2 instances. |
| **Kubernetes Support** | ECS, on the other hand, utilizes its orchestration engine and does not natively support Kubernetes. | EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service, which means it natively supports Kubernetes and enables you to run your Kubernetes workloads on AWS without the need to manage the Kubernetes control plane. |
| **Scaling** | ECS requires you to configure scaling policies for your tasks and services. | EKS is designed to automatically scale your Kubernetes cluster based on demand. |
| **Flexibility** | ECS is more limited in terms of the options available for container orchestration. | EKS offers greater flexibility than ECS concerning container orchestration, as it enables you to tailor and configure Kubernetes to suit your unique needs. |
| **Community** | ECS, conversely, has a smaller community and is predominantly driven by AWS itself. | Kubernetes boasts a sizable and engaged open-source community, resulting in EKS reaping the advantages of extensive community-driven development and assistance. |

In summary, EKS is an excellent choice for managing containerized workloads on AWS using Kubernetes, while ECS is a suitable option for those seeking a simpler, more streamlined platform to run containerized applications.

## ‚úîÔ∏è ECS hands-on practice

Let's engage in an ECS hands-on exercise, during which we will deploy a two-tier application.

### üî∏ Task 1: Creating an ECS cluster

First, we will be creating an ECS cluster.

1. Creating an ECS cluster is simple, just go to the ECS dashboard and click on Create cluster.
    
2. Then provide a name for your cluster.

3. Leave other options a default.

4. And then click on Create. The cluster will take a few minutes to provision.
    

### üî∏ Task 2: Push docker image to ECR

Now, we need to push our Docker image, which will run in ECS, to the Elastic Container Registry. To accomplish this task, ensure that you have the AWS CLI and Docker installed and configured.

1. Pull [this docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/yash6370/flask-app/) into your local machine.
    
2. Create a private ECR registry in your account.

    Now push the docker image into this repository by following the given commands
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698940650746/2db33c96-d63b-4952-8cf4-671a9aa24ce6.png align="center")
    
3. Now, if you open the ECR dashboard, you will see that the image has been uploaded.

### üî∏ Task 3: Run the container on ECS

1. Navigate to the ECS dashboard and choose the ecs-demo cluster that we recently created, then go to the task definition page.
    
2. Now click on create a new task definition, keep in mind that this demo will incur some cost.

    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698941665880/4b56dc5b-3116-4880-a1bd-fa1821f4f2ab.png align="center")
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698941731221/df270bd4-ae19-40d2-bfe7-14406ffac158.png align="center")
    
3. Now, click on "Create." This will create your task definition.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698942065853/4fb8aa8f-52f9-4162-b4ac-dbc7eab5ab4c.png align="center")
    
4. Now select the newly created task, and select the deploy dropdown and click on run task.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698942149577/9223149c-7bd9-4f9e-a9c7-f31eb98c73c9.png align="center")
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698942213502/cbc1b3bd-755b-4f12-b711-e71f99bda37a.png align="center")
    
5. Now, navigate to the ecs-demo cluster and select the Tasks tab. Here, you will see that the task is currently being provisioned.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698942266093/660bbb54-f2cd-4f63-8f96-fa2b956a7ae7.png align="center")
    
    After some time the task will be up and running.
    

After the demo is done remember to delete all the resources that we have created till now to avoid extra charges.

## üìç Conclusion

In this blog, we delved into ECS with a hands-on exercise. However, it's important to note that EKS is more widely used in the industry and is often a topic of discussion in interviews. Therefore, in our upcoming blog posts, we will focus more on learning about EKS.
