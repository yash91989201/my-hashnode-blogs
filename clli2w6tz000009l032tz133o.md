## Introduction:

Hi there amazing readers🎉, after learning how to integrate docker in a pipeline now let's learn about the master-slave architecture in jenkins that helps us to run distributed builds in different systems. Additionally, by the end, we will engage in a hands-on exercise by deploying an end-to-end two-tier application using a pipeline.

## Understanding the master-slave architecture.

The master/slave architecture in Jenkins is used for managing multiple builds. When a build is started, the jenkins master assigns the execution of that build to an agent or slave node. This node is an entirely separate system, to which the Jenkins master connects via SSH and assigns the task of job execution.

### Jenkins Master:

The main jenkins server is the master node, it handles the following tasks:

* Aligning the execution of different jobs to slave nodes.
    
* Monitor and manage the slave by making them online or offline.
    
* Recording and presenting the build results.
    
* Jenkins master can also execute build jobs directly, but this might not be a good idea as the task can consume resources that are needed for managing the server which leads to performance issues.
    

### Jenkins Slave:

A Jenkins slave is a separate system connected to the master node via SSH and runs a Java executable.

* The primary task of a slave node is to execute build jobs given by the Master.
    
* Slaves can be configured for different build environments as required by the project.
    
* By default, the master node can pick any node for job execution but if we want that a specific node should be used for a build then we need to provide a tag for the agent and specify it in the agent section of the pipeline.
    

## Configuring slave for master node:

### Step 1: Pre-requisites

Before we start configuring our master and slave, here are some prerequisites that we need to follow to ensure that our environment is properly set up .

First star two ec2 instances on aws account with t2.micro instance because it comes under the free tier and you won't be charged for it.

1. **On the first machine (master node):** Take the following steps for configuration.
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    # install java 
    sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y 
    # install Jenkins
    wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins.gpg
    sudo sh -c 'echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins.gpg] http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install jenkins
    # check jenkins status
    systemctl status jenkins
    # if the status is active then the installation is successful
    ```
    
    After Jenkins is running properly, do the initial setup for Jenkins by going to the 8080 port on your ec2 instance.
    
2. On the second machine (Slave node): Take the following steps for configuration.
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    # install java 
    sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y 
    # create jenkins user
    sudo useradd --shell /bin/bash -m jenkins
    # change password for jenkins user
    echo "jenkins|jenkins_password" | sudo chpasswd
    # add jenkins to sudoers group
    sudo su
    echo "jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
    # install docker
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install docker.io -y
    # adding jenkins user to docker group
    sudo useradd -aG docker jenkins
    # install docker compose
    mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/
    curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.3.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
    chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
    # check docker compose installation
    docker compose version
    # restart the system to apply docker group changes
    sudo reboot
    ```
    

### Step 2: Configuring ssh on the slave node.

Since the master node communicates with the slave node via SSH, it is necessary to configure SSH on the slave node. Follow the steps below to set up SSH on the slave node.

```bash
# switch to jenkins user
su jenkins 
# enter password when prompted.
mkdir -p .ssh
cd .ssh
# create ssh key pair , keep pressing enter until the process is finished
ssh-keygen
# this will generate a public and private key
# copy public key to authorized_keys file
cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
```

### Step 3: Adding the slave node on the master node.

Now, we need to register the slave node on the master node.

In the dashboard go to Manage Jenkins &gt; System Configuration, select Nodes and Cloud. Then you will see the following screen:

On the next page fill in the following details for your node:

1. **Number of executors:** This determines the number of builds that you can execute simultaneously.
    
2. **Remote root directory:** This is the folder where the workspace for executing the build will be created.
    
3. **Label:** If you provide a label here you can refer to this specific node in your pipeline and use it for builds. In this section give `docker-node` as the label.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692446521644/4900fd44-0028-4e8b-b823-c7f2898f7132.png align="center")
    
    The label section is when you want to assign an agent to a specific job. Then on the launch method select "Launch Agents via SSH".
    
4. In the host, section fill the private IP address of your ec2 instance.
    
5. For credentials select add and then create a new credential after adding it select it.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692443439346/f1c84fba-0b14-45bc-a2d6-82c5afe90cab.png align="center")
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692443583289/dc0b1082-7742-4669-8579-e84b3e4b0a1b.png align="center")
    
    Set the ID and description, then use `jenkins` as the username. For the key, use the contents of the `id_rsa` file. To do this, go to the .ssh directory in the agent node's Jenkins user and run the command `cat id_rsa`.
    
    Copy the contents and paste them into the key section, make sure there are no unnecessary spaces. Finally, click on "Add".
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1692443784756/9fec8498-0784-4bd4-ba67-5ebf1c12ae50.png align="center")
    
    After the key has been added then select the newly created key for the credentials option.
    
6. For the Host Key Verification Strategy option choose the "Non verifying verification strategy".
    
7. Finally click on save, now after some time the agent will be added.

## Finally, let's deploy a two-tier application.

### Step 1: Create docker credentials.

Go to your docker account &gt; Account Settings &gt; Security and then click on

`New Access Token` button.

### Step 3: Configure docker credentials in jenkins.

Go to Manage Jenkins &gt; Credentials &gt; System &gt; Global credentials (unrestricted) and then click on `Add Credentials` button.

1. Select Username with a password.
    
2. In the username section put your docker hub username.
    
3. In the password section put the docker access token that we created just now.
    
4. Give it the id "docker-cicd" and then click on `Create`

### Step 4: Set up a declarative pipeline.

Create a new pipeline project and add a name. Then paste the following pipeline script. For the execution of this pipeline, we will use a specific agent with the label "docker-node" which we created earlier.

After adding the pipeline code save it.

```bash
pipeline{
    agent{
        node{
            label "docker-node"
        }
    }
    stages{
        stage("Code checkout"){
            steps{
                git url: "https://github.com/yash91989201/node-todo-cicd", branch: "master"
            }
        }
        stage("Test code"){
            steps{
                sh "echo 'Code testing succssful.'"   
            }
        }
        stage("Build docker image"){
            steps{
               sh "docker build . -t node-todo-app" 
            }
        }
        stage("Push to docker hub"){
            steps{
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId:"docker-cicd",passwordVariable:"dockerHubPass",usernameVariable:"dockerHubUser")]){
                    sh "docker login -u ${env.dockerHubUser} -p ${env.dockerHubPass}"
                    sh "docker tag node-todo-app ${env.dockerHubUser}/node-todo-app:latest"
                    sh "docker push ${env.dockerHubUser}/node-todo-app:latest" 
                }
            }
        }
        stage("Deploy to server"){
            steps{
                sh "docker compose down && docker compose up -d"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Run the pipeline.

After all the steps are completed it is finally time to build our pipeline and see the magic happen.
