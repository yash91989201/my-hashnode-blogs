## üìç Introduction:

Hello readers, in our previous blog, we saw how to run our application using the deployment object. Now let's learn about two more interesting objects that are very important in the k8s scenario.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Namespaces in Kubernetes:

When we have objects like pods, deployments etc. for different projects within a cluster it becomes difficult to manage them as there is no clear distinction between the resources.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693275187465/e82abc0d-548e-463c-bea3-c6be0d443110.png align="center")

Namespaces in k8s help different projects or teams to share a cluster which provides scope for every name and mechanism to attach authorization and policy to a sub-section of the cluster. Essentially it is a group of related objects that each have a unique name or identifier.

k8s objects like pods, deployments, replica sets etc. can exist within a namespace but low-level resources like nodes and persistent volume are not in any namespace.

When we set up our k8s cluster 4 namespaces are created:

* default
    
* kube-node-lease
    
* kube-public
    
* kube-system
    

Initially the default namespace is used until any other namespace is created.

### üî∏ Working with namespaces:

1. **Viewing namespace:** Use the following command to view all the namespaces
    
    `kubectl get namespace` . To view objects within a specified name space append the -n flag to kubectl command followed by the namespace.
    
2. **Creating namespace:** Create a namespace of your choice with this command
    
    `kubectl create namespace my-namespace`
    
3. **Setting default namespace:** The 'default' namespace is set in k8s to change the default namespace use the following command.
    
    ```bash
    kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=my-namespace 
    ```
    
4. **Using a namespace for creating an object:**
    
    To create an object within a specific namespace use -n flag to specify your namespace.
    
    ```bash
    kubectl run nginx --image=nginx -n=<insert-namespace-name-here>
    ```
    
    In a manifest file you can specify the namespace in the metadata as follows:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
        name: nginxpod
        namespace: dev
    ```
    

## ‚úîÔ∏è Service object in Kubernetes

A service object is a method for exposing an application running in pods to other pods within the cluster, as well as to the outside world. Service uses kube-proxy to forward requests to the correct pods using labels and selectors.

Let's see the different types of service objects available.

### Types of service objects:

1. **Cluster IP:**
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693279429104/54688bc0-0c6b-4760-a7c0-ca40fff49dec.png align="center")
    
    * This creates a cluster of nodes that match the given selectors and provides them with a virtual IP address through which the pods can communicate with each other even if they are on different nodes.
        
    * This virtual IP address is accessible only within a cluster.
        
    * Cluster IP is mainly used when we want to set up communication within our microservices.
        
    * When a Cluster IP is created, it is assigned a static IP address. When traffic is sent to this static IP, it is then rerouted to the pods.
        
    * Creating a cluster ip using manifest file:
        
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: dev-service
          namespace: dev
        spec:
          selector:
            name: testpod
          type: ClusterIP # optional as ClusterIP is the default type
          ports:
            - protocol: TCP
              port: 80
              targetPort: 80
        ```
        
2. **NodePort:**
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693279472377/6aa1feae-fd4f-478f-bafc-35441eaaa6c9.png align="center")
    
    * This type of service allows us to expose our application to the outside world.
        
    * When a NodePort is created, kube-proxy exposes a port in the range 30000-32767
        
    * This utilizes a ClusterIP service along with a port, and through Network Address Translation, it translates the node IP to the cluster IP allowing the users that have the IP address of the node to access the application on pods.
        
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
         name: example-prod
        spec:
         selector:
           app: my-app
           env: prod
         type: NodePort
         ports:
         - protocol: TCP
           port: 80 # port on which the service will listen 
           targetPort: 8080 # port on which the traffic will be redirected to on pod
           nodePort: 32000 # port on which the node will listen
        ```
        
3. **LoadBalancer:**
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693279946317/2805ae4d-db89-45be-94dd-6e9920181396.png align="center")
    
    * This is also another way to expose an application to the outside world.
        
    * It works with the help of cloud-controller-manager because it interacts with the cloud provider.
        
    * The provisioned load balancer will have it's IP address through which the users can access the application.
        
        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: my-loadbalancer-service
        spec:
          selector:
            app: your-app-label  # Label selector for your pods
          ports:
            - protocol: TCP
              port: 80           # Port on the service
              targetPort: 8080   # Port on the pods
          type: LoadBalancer    # Service type
        ```
        

## ‚úîÔ∏è Deploying your application in a namespace.

Let's use the deployment file in our previous blog and add namespace to it.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: todo-app
  labels:
    app: todo
  namespace: dev
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: todo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: todo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: todo
        image: rishikeshops/todo-app-new
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```

After applying this deploy file our pods will be now created within the dev namespace.
