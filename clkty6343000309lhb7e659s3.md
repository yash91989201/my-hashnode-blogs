## 📍 It's Day 3 today:

Hey there! Welcome to Day 3 of our fun-filled Bash Scripting Challenge! 😊 Today, we'll be using our awesome Bash scripting skills to handle user management. Together, we'll create a handy script that lets us add or remove users, reset passwords, list users, and even show helpful usage info for our script. Let's get started! 🎉

<mark>Let's write our script using separate functions so that we can easily manage our code and enhance its readability.</mark>

## ✔ Some helper functions:

Throughout our script, we will need to check if a user exists or not. To improve organization and readability, let's abstract that task into a separate function. Below are two functions that we will be using throughout our script.

```bash
check_user_exists(){
    id "$1" &> /dev/null
     
}
check_group_exists(){
    getent group "$1" &> /dev/null
}
```

## ✔ Create User:

This function first takes user input and checks whether the user exists or not. If the user does not exist, it will create a new user. Next, it prompts for a password. If the password length is less than 4 characters, the user will not be created, and an appropriate message will be printed.

```bash
create_user(){
	echo
	local user_create_success
	local passwd_create_success
	read -p "Enter username: " username
	check_user_exists "$username"
	if (( $? == 0 ))
	then
		echo Error : $username user already exists
	else
		read -p  "Enter password for user - $username : " password
		if (( ${#password} <= 4 ))
		then
			echo Password should be atleast of 4 characters
		else
			if (( $? == 0 )) 
			then
				sudo useradd -g $username -m $username
			else
				sudo useradd -m $username
			fi
			user_create_success=$?
			echo "$username:$password" | sudo chpasswd
			passwd_create_success=$?
			if (( user_create_success == 0 && passwd_create_success == 0  )) 
			then
				echo User added successfully
			else
				sudo userdel -r $username > /dev/null 2>&1
				echo Unable to add user
			fi
		fi
	fi
	echo
}
```

## ✔ Delete user account:

This function initially verifies whether the specified user exists. If the user exists, it proceeds to delete the account; otherwise, it displays an error message.

```bash
delete_user(){
	echo
	read -p "Enter username : " username
	check_user_exists "$username"
	if (( $? == 0 ))
	then
		sudo userdel -r "$username"
		if (( $? == 0 ))
		then 
			echo User - "$username", deleted successfully
		else
			echo Error : unable to delete user
		fi
	else
		echo Error : $username user doesnot exists
	fi
	echo
}
```

## ✔ Reset user password:

This function resets the user password and only accepts passwords with a character length greater than 4; otherwise, it exits the program.

```bash
reset_user_passwd(){
	echo
	read -p "Enter username to reset password : " username
	check_user_exists "$username"
	if (( $? == 1  ))
	then
		echo Error : $username user doesnot exists
	else
		read -p "Enter new password for $username : " password
		if (( ${#password} <= 4 ))
		then 
			echo Password should be atleast of 4 characters
		else
			echo "$username:$password" | sudo chpasswd
			if (( $? == 0 ))
			then 
				echo Password for user "$username" changed successfully
			else	
				echo Error : Unable to change password for user "$username"
			fi
		fi
	fi
	echo	
}
```

## ✔ List users in the system:

This function displays all the existing users in our system by reading the /etc/passwd file and utilizing awk to format the output.

```bash
list_users(){
	echo
	echo "List of users on the system:"
    sudo cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $1}'
	echo
}
```

## ✔ Print script usage info:

This function prints the usage information for our script if the user provides no command-line arguments or if the user includes the -h or --help flag when executing our script.

```bash
display_script_options(){
	echo
	echo "Usage: $0 [OPTIONS]"
	echo Options:
	echo "-c, --create	Create a new user account."
	echo "-d, --delete	Delete an existing user account."
	echo "-r, --reset	Reset password for an existing user account."
	echo "-l, --list	List all user accounts on the system."
	echo "-h, --help	Display this help and exit."
	echo
}
```

## ✔ Putting it all together:

In this example, a case statement is used to check user input from the command line and execute the corresponding function.

```bash
main(){
	case $1 in 
		"-c" | "--create") create_user ;; 
		"-d" | "--delete") delete_user;;
		"-r" | "--reset") reset_user_passwd;;
		"-l" | "--list") list_users;;
		"-h" | "--help") display_script_options;;
		*) display_script_options;;
	esac
}

main "$1"
```

## ✔Let's execute our amazing script:

## 📍 Conclusion:

The script we created above is incredibly useful in everyday life, especially for DevOps engineers who are constantly required to manage users.
