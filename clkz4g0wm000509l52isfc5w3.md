## **üìç** Introduction:

Hey there! So, we just cracked the [mystery bash script](https://yashraj-jaiswal.hashnode.dev/analyzing-a-mysterious-bash-script-part-1-of-day-6) challenge, and now we're diving into a fun new challenge. We'll be fixing a bash script designed for a restaurant ordering system. At first, it's not working, but with our awesome scripting skills, we'll get it up and running in no time!

## ü§î This script seems to be broken and commented with a lot of **TODO**'s:üîß

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to read and display the menu from menu.txt file
function display_menu() {
    echo "Welcome to the Restaurant!"
    echo "Menu:"
    # TODO: Read the menu from menu.txt and display item numbers and prices
    # Format: 1. Burger - ‚Çπ120
    #        2. Pizza - ‚Çπ250
    #        3. Salad - ‚Çπ180
    #        ...
}

# Function to calculate the total bill
function calculate_total_bill() {
    local total=0
    # TODO: Calculate the total bill based on the customer's order
    # The order information will be stored in an array "order"
    # The array format: order[<item_number>] = <quantity>
    # Prices are available in the same format as the menu display
    # Example: If the customer ordered 2 Burgers and 1 Salad, the array will be:
    #          order[1]=2, order[3]=1
    # The total bill should be the sum of (price * quantity) for each item in the order.
    # Store the calculated total in the "total" variable.
    echo "$total"
}

# Function to handle invalid user input
function handle_invalid_input() {
    echo "Invalid input! Please enter a valid item number and quantity."
}

# Main script
display_menu

# Ask for the customer's name
# TODO: Ask the customer for their name and store it in a variable "customer_name"

# Ask for the order
echo "Please enter the item number and quantity (e.g., 1 2 for two Burgers):"
read -a input_order

# Process the customer's order
declare -A order
for (( i=0; i<${#input_order[@]}; i+=2 )); do
    item_number="${input_order[i]}"
    quantity="${input_order[i+1]}"
    # TODO: Add the item number and quantity to the "order" array
done

# Calculate the total bill
total_bill=$(calculate_total_bill)

# Display the total bill with a personalized thank-you message
# TODO: Display a thank-you message to the customer along with the total bill
# The message format: "Thank you, <customer_name>! Your total bill is ‚Çπ<total_bill>."
```

## ‚úî Overview of all the working functionality:

1. **populating the menu:**
    
    * The restaurant's menu is stored in a separate text file to allow easy editing without anyone interacting with the code logic this will make our script more modular.
        
    * The goal is to load the contents of the menu.txt file into a structured data format for manipulation.
        
    * To achieve this, we will use a function called `populate_menu`.
        
    * The `populate_menu` function takes the content of the menu.txt file as input.
        
    * Inside the function, the content is added to an associative array.
        
    * This approach enhances the manageability of menu data, allowing efficient interactions with the menu contents.
        
2. **displaying the menu:**
    
    * Now we need to display the menu to the user.
        
    * This is accomplished through the `display_menu` function.
        
    * Inside the function, a loop iterates through `menu_items` and `menu_item_value`.
        
    * During each iteration, the menu items and their corresponding values are presented to the user.
        
3. **take order:**
    
    * Now to take order from the user we create a function called `take_order`, this function manages the process of placing an order.
        
    * During this process, the user is presented with an individual menu item and prompted to enter the desired quantity for that item.
        
    * The function performs validation by checking if the user's input is a numeric value.
        
    * If the input is not a number, an error message is displayed, and the user is prompted again for input.
        
    * If the user presses enter without entering any value, the function proceeds to the next item.
        
    * When the user enters a valid number, the quantity is added to their order.
        
4. **calculate the total bill:**
    
    * To calculate the bill we create a `calculate_total_bill` function.
        
    * The function performs calculations based on the items and quantities in the user's order that is stored in the previously defined associative arrays.
        
5. **main function:**
    
    * The `main` function serves as the central point where all components of the ordering system are integrated and the ordering process is initiated.
        
    * The execution starts by calling the `display_menu` function to present the menu items and their values to the user.
        
    * Subsequently, the `take_order` function is called, allowing the user to input their desired order quantities.
        
    * Following that, the `calculate_total_bill` function is invoked to compute the total cost of the user's order.
        
    * Finally, a concluding message is displayed to provide the user with the total bill amount.
        
6. **putting it all together:**
    
    * Our restaurant's ordering system operations are coordinated after defining the `main` function.
        
    * The initial step involves populating an array with values from the `menu.txt` file. This is achieved by calling the `populate_menu` function.
        
    * After the array is populated, the `menu` function is called. This function integrates and executes all the functionalities of the restaurant ordering system, offering a comprehensive user experience.
        

## ‚úî Final script:

After fixing the script and implementing all the above-mentioned functionalities, here's the final script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a bash script that simulates a restaurant ordering system.

# Declare associative arrays to store menu item values, ordered quantities, and menu items.
declare -A menu_items
declare -A menu_item_value
declare -A item_quantity_ordered

# Function to read menu items and their values from a file and populate the associative arrays.
function populate_menu() {
    local menu_file="./menu.txt"
    local index=0
    while IFS=", " read -r menu_item menu_item_value; do
        menu_items[$index]=$menu_item
        menu_item_value[$menu_item]=$menu_item_value
        ((index++))
    done < "$menu_file"
}

# Function to display the menu items and their corresponding values.
function display_menu() {
    local index=1
    for key in "${menu_items[@]}"; do
        echo -e "$index. $key \t- ‚Çπ ${menu_item_value[$key]}"
        ((index++))
    done
}

# Function to take the customer's order for various menu items.
function take_order() {
    local index=1
    echo "Menu items will appear one at a time. Enter the quantity when prompted."
    echo "If you don't require an item, just press enter, and we will move to the next item."
    
    # take input for every item in the menu
    for key in "${menu_items[@]}"; do
        # take input from the customer until a numeric value is added 
        while true; do
            read -p "$index. $key: " quantity
            # if input is empty move to next item
            if [[ -z "$quantity" ]]; then
                break
            # add to order only when input is a number    
            elif [[ $quantity =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then 
                item_quantity_ordered["$key"]=$quantity
                break
            # for any input other than a number keep prompting the user for a numeric input
            else
                # Print an informative message to indicate the user that the input can only be a number.
                echo "Invalid input, enter quantity in number. Or press enter if item not required."
                continue
            fi
        done
        ((index++))
    done
}

# Function to calculate the total bill based on the ordered quantities and item values.
function calculate_total_bill() {
    local total=0
    for key in "${menu_items[@]}"; do
        total=$((total + menu_item_value[$key] * item_quantity_ordered[$key]))
    done
    echo $total
}

# Main function to execute the restaurant ordering process.
function main(){
    echo Welcome to the bash blaze restaurant 
    read -p "What's your name please : " customer_name
    echo "$customer_name, here is our amazing menu:"
    # Show the menu to the customer
    display_menu
    echo Ready to order!!
    # Take the customer's order
    take_order
    echo "Enjoy your meal, $customer_name..."
    echo 
    echo
    sleep 2
    echo "Thank you, $customer_name, for dining at our Bash Blaze restaurant."
    # Generate the bill and present it to the customer
    echo "Your total bill is: ‚Çπ$(calculate_total_bill)"
}

# Populate the menu items and values from the file.
populate_menu
# Call the main function to start the ordering process.
main
```
