## **üìç Introduction:**

Woo-hoo! It's Day 6 of the incredible #TWSBashBlazeChallenge! The past 5 days have been all about crafting awesome bash scripts to tackle various problem statements. But hold on to your hats, folks, because today's challenge is going to be a thrilling ride filled with fun and mystery! We're diving into the analysis of a mind-boggling bash script that features a super-secret `mysterious_function`! üéâüîç

## ‚úî **Setting the Stage:**

As the curtains rise, we're introduced to a bash script filled with suspense and intrigue. Our mission? To unveil the hidden objective of this enigmatic code, and in the process, to improve its clarity with well-placed comments and explanations.

To ensure that you have more fun reading this blog, I challenge you to examine the below bash script and try to figure out what the `mysterious_function` does. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüîç Can you crack the code and reveal its hidden purpose? Let's find out! üöÄüéä Feel free to copy the script and run it with your input to examine what's going on.

Here is the script that we will be analyzing.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Welcome to the Mysterious Script Challenge!
# Your task is to unravel the mystery behind this script and understand what it does.
# Once you've deciphered its objective, your mission is to improve the script by adding comments and explanations for clarity.

# DISCLAIMER: This script is purely fictional and does not perform any harmful actions.
# It's designed to challenge your scripting skills and creativity.

# The Mysterious Function
mysterious_function() {
    local input_file="$1"
    local output_file="$2"

    tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < "$input_file" > "$output_file"
    rev "$output_file" > "reversed_temp.txt"
    random_number=$(( ( RANDOM % 10 ) + 1 ))
  
    # Mystery loop
    for (( i=0; i<$random_number; i++ )); do 
        rev "reversed_temp.txt" > "temp_rev.txt"
        tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < "temp_rev.txt" > "temp_enc.txt"
        mv "temp_enc.txt" "reversed_temp.txt"
    done

    rm "temp_rev.txt"
    # The mystery continues...
    # The script will continue with more operations that you need to figure out!
}

if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <input_file> <output_file>"
    exit 1
fi

input_file="$1"
output_file="$2"

if [ ! -f "$input_file" ]; then
    echo "Error: Input file not found!"
    exit 1
fi

# Call the mysterious function to begin the process
mysterious_function "$input_file" "$output_file"

# Display the mysterious output
echo "The mysterious process is complete. Check the '$output_file' for the result!"
```

## ‚úî `mysterious_function` **explained:**

Our script revolves around a mysterious function aptly named `mysterious_function`. This function is the backbone of our adventure, and its steps will guide us through the twists and turns of our quest.

1. **The Initial Transformation:**
    
    In this part, we see an interesting change using the `tr` command. It looks like letters are being changed especially. All small and big letters are switched with letters that are 13 spots away in the alphabet, making a basic type of ROT13 cipher code. The code piece tr `'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'` does this amazing change!
    
    It's a special case of the Caesar cipher, where the shift value is fixed at 13. The beauty of ROT13 is that it's its inverse: applying ROT13 twice to any text will restore the original text. This property makes it a simple and reversible form of text obfuscation.

2. **The Reversal Revelation:**
    
    The next revelation involves reversing the result of the previous step using the `rev` command. This flips the characters, turning our text into a mirror image of itself. Quite the twist, isn't it?
    
3. **Random Loopiness:**
    
    As our adventure goes on, a random number between 1 and 10 is created using the `$RANDOM` variable. This number leads us through an unpredictable loop. The loop happens as many times as the random number, doing a series of changes each time. In the loop, our text is flipped back and forth and then put through the same Caesar cipher encryption we saw before.
    
4. **A Curious Loop Dance:**
    
    The loop goes through a few times, changing the text in interesting ways. It flips the text, scrambles it with a code, and switches parts around, making it more and more confusing.
    
5. **The Grand Finale: Clean Up!**
    
    Like all great adventures, our script finishes by cleaning. It removes temporary files with the `rm` command, leaving no sign of what happened.
    

After analyzing the script here is the script presented with appropriate comments to understand what's going on.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# The Mysterious Function
mysterious_function() {
    local input_file="$1"  # Store the input file path
    local output_file="$2" # Store the output file path
    # Step 1: Apply a ROT13-like cipher to input_file and save the result in output_file
    tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < "$input_file" > "$output_file"
    # Step 2: Reverse the text from output_file and save it in reversed_temp.txt
    rev "$output_file" > "reversed_temp.txt"
    # Step 3: Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    random_number=$(( ( RANDOM % 10 ) + 1 ))
    # Repeat the following block of operations random_number times
    for (( i=0; i<$random_number; i++ )); do
        # Step 4: Reverse the text from reversed_temp.txt and save it in temp_rev.txt
        rev "reversed_temp.txt" > "temp_rev.txt"
        # Step 5: Apply the same ROT13-like cipher to temp_rev.txt and save it in temp_enc.txt
        tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < "temp_rev.txt" > "temp_enc.txt"
        # Step 6: Replace reversed_temp.txt with temp_enc.txt
        mv "temp_enc.txt" "reversed_temp.txt"
    done
    # Clean up: Remove the temporary file temp_rev.txt
    rm "temp_rev.txt"
}

# Main Script Execution

# Check if two arguments are provided
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <input_file> <output_file>"
    exit 1
fi

input_file="$1"  # Store the input file path
output_file="$2" # Store the output file path

# Check if the input file exists
if [ ! -f "$input_file" ]; then
    echo "Error: Input file not found!"
    exit 1
fi

# Call the mysterious function to begin the process
mysterious_function "$input_file" "$output_file"

# Display the mysterious output
echo "The mysterious process is complete. Check the '$output_file' for the result!"
```

## **üìç Conclusion:**

And that's it, brave explorers! We dived into the "Mysterious Script Challenge," figured out its secrets, and explained it clearly. This script changes the text in many ways, like flipping, scrambling, and switching parts. We finish feeling proud and learning more about scripting.üöÄ
