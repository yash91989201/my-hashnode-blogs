DevOps has 3 core principles that support its foundation and they are collaboration, automation and continuous delivery.

1. **Collaboration:** It enables cross-functional teamwork, encouraging developers, and operations personnel to work together seamlessly.
    
2. **Automation:** It streamlines repetitive tasks, allowing teams to focus on innovation and higher-value work.
    
3. **Continuous delivery:** This ensures that software is consistently and reliably deployed, reducing time-to-market and enabling rapid feedback loops.
