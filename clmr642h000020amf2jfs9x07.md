## üìç Introduction

After gaining an understanding of HashiCorp Configuration Language in the [previous blog](https://hashnode.com/post/clmk3acf8000209ichwna5nkn), we will now learn how to use the Terraform provider to create and manage resources on a cloud provider like AWS. For this purpose, we will be utilizing the AWS cloud provider by HashiCorp.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before proceeding make sure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. The latest version of Terraform is installed.
    
2. An AWS user with administrative access.
    
3. AWS CLI is installed on the EC2 instance.
    
4. Logged in as an admin user on the EC2 instance using AWS CLI.
    

## ‚úîÔ∏è Working with ec2 instances

Follow the steps mentioned below to create ec2 instances with terraform:

1. Setting up AWS provider on terraform, by using the terraform block in a separate file named terraform.tf
    
    ```bash
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        aws = {
          source  = "hashicorp/aws"
          version = "~> 5.0"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
2. Set up variables.tf file to store the ami to use for creating an instance.
    
    ```bash
    variable "ami_id" {
      default = "ami-053b0d53c279acc90"
    }
    ```
    
3. Define the necessary resources (like key-pair, VPC and security group) to create an ec2 instance.
    
    ```bash
    # set aws as a provider
    provider "aws" {
      region = "us-east-1"
    }
    # creating key pair to ssh into the instance
    resource "aws_key_pair" "mykey" {
      key_name   = "id_rsa"
      public_key = file("/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
    }
    # declaring the default VPC
    resource "aws_default_vpc" "default_vpc" {}
    # creating a security group to attach to the instance
    resource "aws_security_group" "allow_ssh" {
    
      name = "allow_ssh"
      tags = {
        Name = "allow_ssh"
      }
      # using default vpc
      vpc_id = aws_default_vpc.default_vpc.id
      ingress {
        description = "ssh access to ec2 instances"
    
        # inbound and outbound rules
        from_port = 22
        to_port   = 22
        protocol  = "tcp"
    
        # allows all traffic
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
      }
    }
    
    # creating an ec2 instance 
    resource "aws_instance" "myec2instance" {
    
      ami             = var.ami_id
      instance_type   = "t2.micro"
      key_name        = aws_key_pair.mykey.key_name
      security_groups = [aws_security_group.allow_ssh.name]
      tags = {
        Name = "myec2instance"
      }
    }
    ```
    

Now we have three files namely variables.tf , terraform.tf and ec2.tf , follow next steps to apply and create the resources within your AWS account.

```bash
# initialize terraform in the current directory
terraform init
# review the changes that will be applied
terraform plan
# execute this command to create the mentioned resource in the terraform file
terraform apply

# to bring down all the resources created by the terraform file 
# execute the following command
terraform destroy
```

### üî∏ Examining the results

After applying the terraform file we can see that the resources have been created.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Working with s3 bucket

To create a basic s3 bucket we need the following configuration:

```bash
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "app_dev" {
  bucket = "my-app-image-storage-bucket"
}
```

Save the following code in a file named s3.tf and apply to create a s3 bucket.

### üî∏ Examining the results

After applying the terraform file we can see that the resources have been created.
